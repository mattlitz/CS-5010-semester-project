## INTRODUCTION
This project will be looking at several datasets that will be useful for building a comprehensive equity trading and real estate investing strategy.  First, we will analyze the SEC 13F filings of successful hedge funds to determine the stocks and sectors that are most heavily invested in the quarter analyzed.  Next we will analyze data sets from several public websites to determine if a correlation exists between job postings in a US region and housing market conditions.  These two analyses could help investment professionals open positions in equities and real estate investing.

## THE DATA
The following data sets will be used:
* Job postings from Indeed.com
* Unemployment for the US from: 
* FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)oUS bureau of labor statistics 
* 13F filings for popular hedge funds from WhaleWisdom.com
* Zillow data for real estate listings

This data will be cleaned and categorized for the appropriate analysis.

## EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
First data from the sources will either be web scraped or accessed by web socket through an API.  Next our application will clean the data and we envision several aggregate and join operations will be conducted.  Next statistical analysis of the data sets will identify trends in the data to identify potential trading opportunities.3

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT
Cleaning operations will be split up between the team members.  We are currently meeting on a weekly basis to provide status updates on the project.  The code will be hosted and managed through GitHub.RESULTSThe code will produce output charts and graphs with any conclusions from the analysis.  

## TESTING
Our functions will be tested to ensure the efficacy of the data collection and cleaning operations.

## OUTCOME
These results will be useful for investment professionals in building an effective trading strategy.  The code we build will create an automated data analysis system that can be immediately used as data becomes available from the data sources.
